The used LLM tool
Motivation/reason to use LLM
How and why LLM helped
What kind of mistakes LLM did
What were things that LLM was not able to provide

In this exercise, LLM tool was used for researching to understand the network of 3 services. 
I did it because I read and understood the assignment, but I am not sure if I understood it 
right and how to get started. It also helped me with the helper functions to get metrics. 
Specifically, ChatGPT model GPT-5 was used. I guarantee that I actively did this assignment 
by writing the code and I actually understood how the network works.

Well at the beginning it didn't explain really well what the recorded log is but only gave me 
the code of that part. I had to ask follow up questions to get reasonable answer.

I have no idea for the last question, but maybe the version of tools that ChatGPT used in its
code was outdated?
